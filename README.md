This is a historical place :)

These Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo models were a core of my Masters degree and my first step in coding complex algorithms and C. They were created in 2007 but still brings back good memories :)

Molecular Dynamics of gas:

    Leap Frog algorithm
    Verlet algorithm

Monte Carlo:

    Cross cutting / non-cutting polymer model
    Crawling polymer model
